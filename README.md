# FunWithComputerVision
Four Computer Vision Algorithms are implement in this project

1.Connected Component Labeling Algorithm

2.Distance Transform algorithm

3.Thresholding Algorithm

4.Edge Dectection Algorithm

I used Xcode to manage this project, since debug the coding while working on it.

Have fun.
